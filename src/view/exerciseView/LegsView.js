            Squeeze your glutes and push through your right foot, raising your hips until your body forms a straight line from your right knee to your shoulders. Make sure to keep your hips parallel with the floor throughout the movement.

            Cross your left ankle behind your right, hold onto an immovable object with your left hand for balance, and lower your right heel toward the floor (but donâ€™t touch it).
            Rise up on the toes of your right foot as high as you can, giving your right calf an extra squeeze at the top.
